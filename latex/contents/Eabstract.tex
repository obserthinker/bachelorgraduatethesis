\begin{Eabstract}{FDTD}{CUDA}{VALU}{data parallelism}{hardware accelerate}
In this paper, we did some researches on two main hradware accelerating methods. As to the way of using vector algorithm logic unit (VALU), we analyze its theory at first, and then we proposed a new computational model based on traditional computational model under some specific boundary conditions. Compared with traditional model, the advanced model can save about 3.45\% time.

The another method, accelerating by compute unified device arthitecture (CUDA), we implement FDTD under PEC, Mur, and CPML boundary conditions. Then, we compared this way with VALU way. At last, we obtain the performance of every method.
