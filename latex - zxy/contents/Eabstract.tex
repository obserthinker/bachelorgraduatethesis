\begin{Eabstract}{LNA(low noise amplifier) }{Ka band}{TGA4508}{}{}
With the development of communication technology, spectrum resources are very scarce, millimeter wave technology develops rapidly for the unique advantage of millimeter wave technology and the rapid development of millimeter-wave monolithicintegrated circuits. Application of millimeter wave technology is more and more . Therefore, the millimeter-wave technology has a promising future. This paper mainly design a kind of Ka band low noise amplifier. Use TGA4508 designed by TriQuint company, use ADS to stimulate it. The final goal is have a good performance.
