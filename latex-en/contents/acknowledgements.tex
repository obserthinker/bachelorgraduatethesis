After an intensive period of several months, today is the day to write this note of thanks. It has been a period of intense learning for me, not only in the scientific arena, but also on a personal level. Writing this thesis has had a big impact on me. I would like to reflect on the people who have supported and helped me so much throughout this period.

Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Shengjian Lai for the continuous support of my bachelor study and research, for his patience, motivation, enthusiasm, and immense knowledge. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my bachelor study.

Besides, I would like to thank my parents, for giving birth to me at the first place and supporting me spiritually throughout my life.

Finally, there are my friends. We were not only able to support each other by deliberating over our problems and findings, but also happily by talking about things other than just papers.
